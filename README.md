# PyShooting

A Python Implementation of a Shooting-Algorithm with Numerical Continuation and Automatic Differentiation for Structural Dynamics

The code is available to interested researchers.
The code is not for commercial use.

    PyShooting is a program that uses the Shooting Method for Periodic Steady-state
    Nonlinear Structural Dynamics. 
    It also performs numerical continuation to build the frequency response,
    as well as nonlinear normal modes.
